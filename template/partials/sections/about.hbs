                Formed in the summer of {{band.foundingYear}} by members of the Stanford Band, <span class="font-bold text-purple-400" itemprop="alternateName">Sinister Dexter</span> 
                was created to fill the need for a great local party band. Started by horn players, we put together a band that we wanted to go see – 
                which of course meant a horn-heavy sound and classic funk music inspired by Tower of Power and the Blues Brothers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                We started by playing college parties and small Bay Area clubs like the Quarter Note in Sunnyvale and Blue Chalk Cafe in Palo Alto. 
                In May 2004, we got our first chance to play in San Francisco at the legendary Lost & Found Saloon, where we became regulars and played 
                a sold-out New Year's Eve show to close out 2004.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                As the band matured, we expanded into blues, rock, ska, and Latin jazz – anything with a solid groove that we could put great horn parts to. 
                In 2004, we recorded and self-produced our debut CD, <span class="italic text-amber-400">Dexterity</span>, featuring 16 original tracks 
                spanning all the genres we'd explored over the years.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                In mid-2005, lightning struck when we recruited the incredible <span class="font-bold text-amber-400" itemprop="member" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Rebecca Lipon</span></span> 
                as our new lead vocalist. A founding member of the jazz quartet Off Beats with over 15 years of opera and musical theater training, 
                Rebecca forced us to take things to the next level. We refined our sound, trimmed the fat, and got back to our core concept as a funk and soul band.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Today, we're an {{bandMembersCount}}-piece soul machine featuring Rebecca's powerhouse vocals, a hot six-piece horn section, and a rock-solid rhythm section. 
                Our high-energy shows have been described as "Tower of Power, Ozomatli, and Joss Stone in a blender" – bringing 
                <span class="italic text-purple-400">the right to be funky</span> to venues throughout the Bay Area.
