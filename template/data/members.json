She was a founding member of the Off Beats, a Jazz quartet, in her late teens, studied opera and musical theater styles for over 15 years, and performed professionally with theater groups in Northern California, Boston and New York. She has been Sinister Dexter's lead singer since 2005, and loves the mix of soul, funk and blues music.",

Critics have described his organ solos as \"really f*#$ing loud\".",

Because of his love for music from the sixties and seventies (and disgust with music from the eighties and nineties), he often thinks he was born a couple of decades too late. By day, Kevin is an Oscar-winning engineer for Industrial Light & Magic.",

After a brief hiatus while raising young kids, he returned full-time several years ago and added bari sax to his repertiore.

Starting as a trombone player in bands and orchestras in 9th grade, Adam picked up trumpet after college and decided to stick with it when SinDex began, both because the band already had two great trombone players and because it's way easier to carry a trumpet around. In the rare moments when he's not busy helping raise a kid or designing voice experiences for a large tech company, he likes to arrange and occasionally compose original music.",
