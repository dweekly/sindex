Years of Funk</h3> <p class="mb-6 text-lg"> Formed in the summer of 1998 by members of the Stanford Band, <span class="font-bold text-purple-400">Sinister Dexter</span> was created to fill the need for a great local party band. Started by horn players, we put together a band that we wanted to go see – which of course meant a horn-heavy sound and classic funk music inspired by Tower of Power and the Blues Brothers. </p> <p class="mb-6 text-lg"> We started by playing college parties and small Bay Area clubs like the Quarter Note in Sunnyvale and Blue Chalk Cafe in Palo Alto. In May 2004, we got our first chance to play in San Francisco at the legendary Lost & Found Saloon, where we became regulars and played a sold-out New Year's Eve show to close out 2004. </p> <p class="mb-6 text-lg"> As the band matured, we expanded into blues, rock, ska, and Latin jazz – anything with a solid groove that we could put great horn parts to. In 2004, we recorded and self-produced our debut CD, <span class="text-amber-400 italic">Dexterity</span>, featuring 16 original tracks spanning all the genres we'd explored over the years. </p> <p class="mb-6 text-lg"> In mid-2005, lightning struck when we recruited the incredible <span class="font-bold text-amber-400">Rebecca Lipon</span> as our new lead vocalist. A founding member of the jazz quartet Off Beats with over 15 years of opera and musical theater training, Rebecca forced us to take things to the next level. We refined our sound, trimmed the fat, and got back to our core concept as a funk and soul band. </p> <p class="text-lg"> Today, we're an 11-piece soul machine featuring Rebecca's powerhouse vocals, a hot six-piece horn section, and a rock-solid rhythm section. Our high-energy shows have been described as "Tower of Power, Ozomatli, and Joss Stone in a blender" – bringing <span class="text-purple-400 italic">the right to be funky</span> to venues throughout the Bay Area. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="px-6 py-20 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-900/30 to-amber-900/30" id="pull-quote"> <div class="text-center mx-auto max-w-4xl"> <blockquote class="relative"> <svg class="-left-4 -top-8 absolute h-16 text-purple-500/30 w-16" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 32 32"> <path d="M9.352 4C4.456 7.456 1 13.12 1 19.36c0 5.088 3.072 8.064 6.624 8.064 3.36 0 5.856-2.688 5.856-5.856 0-3.168-2.208-5.472-5.088-5.472-.576 0-1.344.096-1.536.192.48-3.264 3.552-7.104 6.624-9.024L9.352 4zm16.512 0c-4.8 3.456-8.256 9.12-8.256 15.36 0 5.088 3.072 8.064 6.624 8.064 3.264 0 5.856-2.688 5.856-5.856 0-3.168-2.304-5.472-5.184-5.472-.576 0-1.248.096-1.44.192.48-3.264 3.456-7.104 6.528-9.024L25.864 4z"/> </svg> <p class="text-white font-light italic mb-6 md:text-3xl text-2xl"> Tower of Power, Ozomatli, and Joss Stone in a blender </p> <cite class="text-purple-400 text-lg not-italic">— Mountain View Voice</cite> </blockquote> </div> </section> <section class="px-6 py-20 bg-gradient-to-b from-purple-950/30 to-black" id="band-members" aria-labelledby="members-heading"> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl"> <h2 class="text-center bebas gradient-text md:text-6xl text-5xl mb-4" id="members-heading">The Band</h2> <p class="text-gray-400 text-center max-w-3xl mb-12 mx-auto"> 11 talented musicians bringing you the finest funk and soul </p> <div class="grid gap-6 grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 md:grid-cols-3"> <div class="text-center group"> <div class="relative inline-block mb-3"> <picture> <source type="image/webp" srcset="images/members/rebecca.webp"> <img alt="Rebecca Lipon Weekly" class="object-cover group-hover:scale-105 border-2 border-purple-500 group-hover:border-purple-400 h-32 mx-auto rounded-full transition-all w-32" src="images/members/rebecca.jpg"> </picture> </div> <h3 class="text-white font-bold">Rebecca Lipon Weekly</h3> <p class="text-sm text-purple-400"> <span class="inline-block mr-1">🎤</span> <span>Lead Vocals</span> </p> <div class="rounded-lg p-4 -translate-x-1/2 absolute bg-gray-900 group-hover:opacity-100 left-1/2 max-w-md mt-2 opacity-0 pointer-events-none shadow-xl transform transition-opacity w-80 z-20"> <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-300">Rebecca's love of singing started with Sesame Street, much to her siblings' chagrin, and it never stopped.
