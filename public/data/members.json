      "bio": "Rebecca's love of singing started with Sesame Street, much to her siblings' chagrin, and it never stopped. She was a founding member of the Off Beats, a Jazz quartet, in her late teens, studied opera and musical theater styles for over 15 years, and performed professionally with theater groups in Northern California, Boston and New York. She has been Sinister Dexter's lead singer since 2005, and loves the mix of soul, funk and blues music."

      "bio": "Daniel started playing piano like everyone else, because Mom made him take lessons. But then he got hooked, switching from classical to jazz in high school, playing in various jazz combos in college, and in 2004 switching again to funky tasty groovaliciousness with sindex. Critics have described his organ solos as \"really f*#$ing loud\"."

He also plays clarinet and soparano sax, but Kenny G ruined that instrument for everyone. Because of his love for music from the sixties and seventies (and disgust with music from the eighties and nineties), he often thinks he was born a couple of decades too late. By day, Kevin is an Oscar-winning engineer for Industrial Light & Magic.",

Starting as a trombone player in bands and orchestras in 9th grade, Adam picked up trumpet after college and decided to stick with it when SinDex began, both because the band already had two great trombone players and because itâ€™s way easier to carry a trumpet around. In the rare moments when heâ€™s not busy helping raise a kid or designing voice experiences for a large tech company, he likes to arrange and occasionally compose original music.",
